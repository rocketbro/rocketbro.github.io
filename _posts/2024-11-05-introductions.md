## The Future Hath Arrived

In the future, I know how to make websites. Well, that future is here. I made this whole website myself with load of help from Claude.  

I am working on a myriad of projects, and this site will serve as the hub to track progress on all of them. Eventually, I will move my portfolio over here as well.  

That's all for now.
