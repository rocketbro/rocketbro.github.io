# Old Fashioned Biscuits

## Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2½ tsp Clabber Girl Baking Powder
- ½ tsp salt
- ⅓ cup shortening
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 Tbsp soft butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 475°F.

2. In a medium mixing bowl stir together 2 cups flour, 2½ tsp baking powder, and ½ tsp salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in ⅓ cup shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add ¾ cup milk all at once. Using a fork, stir just until moistened and dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl (dough will be sticky).

4. On a floured surface, lightly knead dough with floured hands for 30 seconds or until nearly smooth.

5. Lightly roll dough to ¾-inch thickness. Cut dough with a 2½-inch biscuit cutter, dipping cutter into flour between cuts.

6. Place biscuits close together on a lightly greased baking sheet. Brush tops with 1 Tbsp soft butter.

7. Bake for 11 to 15 minutes or until golden brown.

8. Serve warm.

Yield: Makes about 8 biscuits
