# Creamy Chicken Pasta with Spinach
*Recipe from Salt & Lavender*

## Ingredients (tripled)

- 24 ounces uncooked pasta
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 (5.2 ounce) packages Boursin Fine Herbs & Garlic cheese, softened
- 2.25 cups chicken broth
- 1.5 cups heavy/whipping cream
- 1.5 teaspoons lemon juice
- 3-6 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 0.75 teaspoon onion powder
- 0.75 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 6 cups cooked/rotisserie chicken, shredded
- 6 cups (packed) fresh baby spinach
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Freshly grated parmesan cheese (optional, to taste)

## Instructions

1. **Boil a salted pot of water and cook the pasta al dente** according to package directions.

2. **Meanwhile, melt the butter** in a skillet over medium-high heat, then cook the garlic for 30 seconds â€“ 1 minute.

3. **To the skillet, add** the Boursin, chicken broth, cream, lemon juice, parsley, onion powder, and Italian seasoning. Stir well until combined. When it just starts to boil, turn the heat down a bit and let it bubble steadily for 5 minutes.

4. **Stir in the chicken and spinach** and cook for a couple more minutes until heated through and the spinach has wilted. Keep in mind that the sauce will continue to thicken as it cools, so don't let it reduce too much. If the sauce has thickened up too much, add in a splash of the hot pasta water prior to draining it.

5. **Add in the drained pasta and toss.** Taste and season with salt & pepper as needed and serve with freshly grated parmesan cheese if desired.

*Note: Recipe can be scaled using the portion controls (0.5x, 1x, 2x, 3x) depending on serving needs.*
