I am starting a blog - mainly just to keep track of and document what I'm working on. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time and today I finally got a basic site put together. I decided to go with [Google Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) because it's entirely free to use and really simple, something I see as an advantage. I tend to get lost in the weeds of small tweaks and I wanted a website where I could quickly get to writing without distractions. Blogger fit the bill.

Another reason I'm starting a blog now is that I am about to begin the long process of starting a company. I am working on honing in on the right idea and the right market, but the direction I'm headed is pro-level iPad apps - a market which I find is severely untapped. For the past year or so, I have used an iPad as my main driver. They can do a whole lot, but there are still a lot of areas where they simply cannot compete with their desktop cousins. In just about every case, I think there is a very strong argument to be made that it comes down to the software. And after enough years of waiting for someone else to make the apps you want, you decide to learn to do it yourself.

I'm a newbie at software development. I've played around with basic coding since high school in Java and Python, but this summer I decided to work through an actual course for Swift, Apple's own programming language (geared towards development on their platforms). Paul Hudson of [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/) has a completely free app called [Unwrap](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/unwrap) that covers all the core concepts. There are quizzes and practice tests and a ton of extremely helpful resources built right in. It gave me a great jumpstart, and although I'm far from being a qualified developer, I'm closer than I was before. 

This blog will be a space to record what I'm doing, learning, creating, and thinking, as well as a place to collect all the resources I find along the way. I hope you find it helpful and in some way applicable to what you're working on too.
