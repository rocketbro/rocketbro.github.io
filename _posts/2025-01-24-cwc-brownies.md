[Based on this recipe from Sally's Baking Addiction](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/seriously-fudgy-homemade-brownies/)

## Equipment Needed
- 9x13-inch Baking Pan (Metal or Glass)
- Glass Mixing Bowl
- Whisk
- Silicone Spatula or Wooden Spoon
- Cooling Rack

## Ingredients & Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan or line with aluminum foil or parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides for easier removal.

2. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine:
- 3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter
- 1/3 cup (57g) semi-sweet chocolate chips
   
Melt in 30-second increments, whisking after each, until completely smooth. Or you can just do it on the stove in a skillet and add it to the rest of the stuff when it's done. 

3. Whisk in:
- 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
Then add:
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
   
The batter will be light brown and look a bit dull.

4. Add and fold together with a silicone spatula or wooden spoon:
- 1 cup (82g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder
- 1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Another 1/3 cup (57g) chocolate chips
- Optional: additional 1 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips

Batter will be very thick. Spread evenly into prepared pan.

5. Bake for 30 minutes, then test with a toothpick in the center:
- If it comes out with wet batter, brownies aren't done
- If there are only a few moist crumbs, brownies are done
- Continue checking every 2 minutes until done
- Typically takes 31-32 minutes total

6. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.

## Storage & Make Ahead
- Cover and store leftover brownies at room temperature for up to 1 week
- Freeze for up to 3 months
- To thaw: Place in refrigerator overnight, then bring to room temperature before serving

## Recipe Notes
- **Sugar Variation**: Try using 1/2 cup (100g) light brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar for a delicious variation
- **Cocoa Powder**: Both natural and dutch-process work well; dutch-process preferred for smoother flavor
- **Chocolate Bars**: Recommended brands include Ghirardelli, Baker's, or Lindt
