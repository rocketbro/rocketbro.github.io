### How To Use An API

[Loom: LLM Interface](/projects/loom-interface) requires you to provide an Anthropic or OpenRouter API key to talk to models. If you are used to signing into apps like ChatGPT or Claude with an email/password or a Google account, you may not know what an API is, since these apps typically handle everything for you under the hood. Here's a breif explanation of what an API is and how it works.  

An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a waiter in a restaurant. You (the customer) give your order (the API call) to the waiter, who then brings your food (the data or service you requested).  

But not just anyone can place an order. To get what you want, you need to prove your identity (an API key). It's like ordering a drink at a bar - you show your ID to prove you're allowed to make the request, and then the bartender gives you your drink.  

When you use an app that needs an API key, it's like the app is ordering a drink for you. You give the app your ID (the API key), and then the app shows your ID to the bartender (the API) when it makes the order (API call) on your behalf.  

So in short:

- APIs are like waiters, taking orders and bringing what you asked for
- API calls are like your food or drink orders, requesting specific data or services
- API keys are like your ID, proving you're allowed to make requests


You can visit the [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) websites to create keys (you will need to make an account on these services). Once you have your keys, you can paste them into the Loom app from the settings screen. You will need to purchase credits for your account on each website (you can also choose to use one service *or* the other; OpenRouter provides access to Anthropic's models along with hundreds of others). Your credits will decrease based on your usage.
