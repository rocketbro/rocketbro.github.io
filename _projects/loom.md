Loom is based on the idea that conversations are not linear but can branch into multiple possibilities. The app lets users create conversation trees by branching off of any message, allowing them to explore how a dialogue could evolve differently with varied inputs. This approach enables users to manage and explore multiple paths at the same time, pruning the conversation to hone in, bit by bit, on the desired output.  

Loom connects to the Anthropic and Openrouter APIs. Many exciting features are planned for the near future, including: 

- Image input
- Tool use
- Model access to native iOS Shortcuts
- Voice mode
- Gaming and Developer modes
- Android native version
