# Loom: LLM Interface
<hr>
### Go Beyond AI Chat

[Loom: LLM Interface](/projects/loom-interface) is an iOS app for talking to large language models that feels like a messaging app, but packs in loads of extra functionality to unlock the actual potential of your human-AI interactions. What you dream and imagine is possible is largely shaped by the interface with which you interact.

Right now, popular AI interfaces almost all enforce linear thinking - one "best" or "correct" way for the conversation to go, with no ability to generate two or three or twenty continuations to the same prompt, compare, then continue from any or *all* of them at will. Loom lets your interactions flow the way your imagination does. Read about it on the [project page](/projects/loom-interface).  

*Tech Stack, Funtionality, & Frameworks*
- Swift & SwiftUI
- SwiftData for persistent storage
- Custom Swift clients to interface with Anthropic & OpenRouter APIs
- Apple Keychain & Biometric Auth for API key storage
- AVSpeechSynthesizer for beta voice mode
- Import & export JSON files for conversation sharing
- Dynamic UI/UX settings, including custom fonts, message styling, and more

# Interactive Android Kiosk
<hr>
### 42" Touchscreen Display

The Missions & Outreach department of [Christ Covenant Church](https://christcovenant.org) wanted a way for members to easily stay up to date on their supported workers around the globe. After getting a few quotes that didn't quite satisfy their desires, I built a custom solution using [Elo hardware](https://www.elotouch.com/) and a from-scratch Android app. [View the code on GitHub](https://github.com/rocketbro/CCC-SouthLobbyDisplay).  

*Tech Stack, Funtionality, & Frameworks*
- Kotlin & Jetpack Compose
- Clean, thoughtful UI & UX for a large display being used at arm's length
- Dynamically draw interactive pins on global map based on Airtable data
- Airtable for easy-to-handoff remote backend
- Custom Kotlin client to interface with Airtable API
