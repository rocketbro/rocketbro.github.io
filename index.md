Yo! This site is an active notebook to get things out of my brain and into some readable format that I can iterate on and use to track progress. A bit about me and my work...

# Intrinsic Labs LLC
I own and operate a small tech studio called Intrinsic Labs LLC. We primarily focus on software development in the native mobile space, typically with some combination of the following stack:
#### iOS Native
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData

#### Android Native
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Room

#### UI & UX Design
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop
- Affinity Designer

Active software projects include [Loom: LLM Interface](/projects/loom-interface) and  [Record Machine](/projects/record-machine). We are currently working on our first web based application, for which we're using **React** and **Node.js** (more details coming soon). Don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:helloworld@intrinsiclabs.co) if you're interested in working together or just bouncing ideas around.

Intrinsic Labs' other primary field is video production. I have 12+ years experience in the video world, ranging from interview-style studio shoots to 3D animation to live rock show recaps. You can watch my 2024 reel below:
