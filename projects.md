Here you'll find a list of projects I've worked on/am currently working on. This page is still being fleshed out - [check out my GitHub page](https://github.com/rocketbro) to see the very latest updates. If you're interested in any of these or in collaborating, please reach out.

<div class="project-grid">

      <div class="project-card">
        <h3><a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.project_title }}</a></h3>
        <p>{{ project.type }} â€¢ {{ project.description }}</p>
